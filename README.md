# giphy-catalog

## This application is dedicated to those who has a dream to catch 'em all!

The catalog is preloaded with my favorite pokemon, but you can add 'em all!

* When you click on the pokemon on the list displayed on the left, it loads the evolution chain of the pokemon in collapsible sections. 

* When clicked on each section, the page grabs the first 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. The Pokemon is then added to the catalog list on the left

* When you add your own pokemons to the list, the page only accept pokemon listed in poke API, you will not be allowed to add anything other than listed pokemon



## Features:
* When you click on the still GIPHY images, the gif will come to life. If you click the gif again, it will stop playing.

* Under every gif, it's title and rating is displayed

* The app is fully mobile responsive via media queries.

* Support infinite scroll to load additional gifs to be added to the page.

* Include 1-click download button for each gif, this should work across device types by tapping the download icon.
